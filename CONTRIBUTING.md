# Contributing to `pyhb`
  - First, thank you for wanting to improve `pyhb`. We gracefully appreciate many kinds of positive  contributions. 
  - But before attempting to do so, we kindly expect you to read this document entirely. As we may reject invalid 
    contributions that did not follow the rules listed below even in they were made with positive intent.

## Non-Code related contributions
  - You don't need to write code to contribute to `pyhb`!
  - Checking for spelling mistakes, improving the wording of documents such as these, sharing our project with others,
    giving your feedback on issues, bugs or new features you feel may be a good addition to `pyhb`
    through the issues section, are all contributions that are extremely helpful and often more
    than minor code related contributions.

## Code related contributions
  - Before writing some code or making any changes, read our <a href="https://github.com/blankRiot96/pyhb/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#Issues">issues</a> document is recommended.
  - Since we may reject pull requests if there was no issue made, even if you had put a lot of effort and time 
    into it. It would be upsetting for both sides if such an event happens, so posting an issue unless it is a very
    small change is highly recommended.
  - Okay, you have made it this far, by now if you had followed the instructions along the way, we believe you 
    are ready to start writing some code!
  - Read our guide on <a href="https://github.com/blankRiot96/pyhb/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#Writing-code-for-pyhb">writing code for pyhb</a>

## Issues
  - There is no need to make issues for small changes such as typo correction or few line code changes.
  - There are existing issues already which have been labelled as `accepted` which you could work on.
  - To write your own issue, we recommend keeping the title short and descriptive enough, and keeping the comment as per
    the following format:
  ```
**What are the problems faced/unsolved related to your issue?**
<!---
Remove this and write your answer here
-->

**Are there any solutions you have considered?**
<!---
List all the solutions you have considered
-->

**Additional context**
<!---
Screenshots, or any other additional context goes here
-->
```
  - Keep in mind we will close your issue if it already exists or has been solved
